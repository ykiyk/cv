                    Hello guys my self jaswanth im a viewer and a big fan of naruto.In the begining i love naruto chara ter alot
                    but as the time passes i started to like madara and obito alot lets talk about madara and obito views of peace
                    Zetsu and Obito — using Madara's name — approached Nagato's organisation, Akatsuki, with an offer of support.
                    The leader at the time, Yahiko, refused his help, but Obito claims he later changed his mind.[6] Upon Yahiko's 
                    death due to Hanzō, Nagato summoned the Demonic Statue and linked himself to it in a failed attempt to avenge Yahiko.
                    In the aftermath, Nagato became the new leader of Akatsuki and he accepted Obito's assistance and guidance,
                    though only he and Konan would ever know of Obito's contributions.
                    <br>
                    Obito told Nagato, a victim of the world's wars, that the world could be forced to stop fighting by creating a powerful 
                    weapon from the nine tailed beasts. Over the following decade, Nagato led Akatsuki to that end, first gathering manpower
                    and resources before it began capturing the tailed beasts. In time, Akatsuki succeeds in sealing the first seven beasts 
                    into the Demonic Statue; by then both Zetsu and Obito (using the alias of "Tobi") join Akatsuki as members. But such
                    successes came with several costs: through frequent conflict with Konoha-ninja, Akatsuki loses most of its members;
                    Nagato has a change of heart and gives his life to revive the villagers of Konoha he killed during Pain's Assault,
                    with Konan defecting from Akatsuki afterwards; because the tailed beasts were predominately possessed by the Five
                    Great Shinobi Countries, capturing so many compelled a response to Akatsuki by the ninja world.
                    <br>
                    <b>"Madara"</b> shares the Eye of the Moon Plan.<br>
                    With Akatsuki no longer able to move in the shadows and with the Eye of the Moon Plan's completion so near, Obito starts 
                    taking drastic measures. He sends Sasuke Uchiha to assault a Five Kage Summit held in the Land of Iron, hoping to weaken
                    the convened Kage enough to force them to cooperate. When Sasuke fails and is nearly killed, Obito, still using Madara's name,
                    steps in. After getting Sasuke to safety, he shares details about the Eye of the Moon Plan and the peaceful world he hopes to
                    create with those assembled, and asks that they hand over the two remaining tailed beasts, the Eight-Tails and Nine-Tails, in
                    order to help him achieve this peace. He is refused, prompting him to declare the start of the Fourth Shinobi World War.

        While the ninja world organises itself into the Allied Shinobi Forces and Obito readies the White Zetsu Army,
        Black Zetsu becomes concerned that Madara's plans are not being followed. As such, it approaches Kabuto Yakushi 
        and reveals Madara's resting place to him so that he can use it to reincarnate Madara and blackmail Obito.
        Obito reluctantly accepts Kabuto's assistance with the war effort and goes to Amegakure to retrieve Madara's 
        Rinnegan from Nagato's body. He implants the left Rinnegan into himself and hides the other, partly because he 
        is unable to handle the power of two Rinnegan but predominately because he does not want Madara to have it.

                    The first day of the Fourth Shinobi World War is largely uneventful, though there are heavy casualties on both sides. 
                    Obito is able to acquire the Kohaku no Jōhei and Benihisago, within which are sealed the Gold and Silver Brothers, 
                    who have some of the Nine-Tails' chakra. On the second day, the Nine-Tails' jinchūriki, Naruto Uzumaki, enters the 
                    fight and almost all of Kabuto's reincarnated forces are defeated, forcing him to mobilise Madara. From the fact that 
                    he has not been revived correctly, Madara can tell Obito has deviated from the plan. When Obito learns of Madara's 
                    appearance on the battlefield he tries to capture Naruto and Killer B, the Eight-Tails' jinchūriki.
                    <br>
                    The Ten-Tails revived.
                 <br>
                 Obito is unable to capture either Naruto or B by the time that Kabuto is defeated. With his time running out, 
                 he places the Kohaku no Jōhei and Benihisago within the Demonic Statue to, in combination with the other seven 
                 tailed beasts and a portion of Eight-Tails's chakra that Akatsuki acquired in a prior failed attempt to capture it, 
                 begin the Ten-Tails' rebirth. Madara, having cancelled his contract with the Impure World Reincarnation, tracks Obito 
                 down and chides him for failing to follow the Eye of the Moon Plan as he envisioned it.
                 <br>
                 Madara tries to capture B and Naruto 
                 before the Ten-Tails is reborn, but he is unsuccessful.Obito and Madara take control of the Ten-Tails to try and destroy 
                 the remnants of the Allied Sh inobi Forces, but enough survive to separate the Ten-Tails from their control.
                 In the confusion that follows, Obito is able to leave the battlefield long enough to remove the Forbidden Individual Curse Tag from his body,
                 releasing him from Madara's long-standing influence. When he returns, Madara attempts to force him to use his Rinnegan to restore Madara to
                 life, but this fails when Obito defies Madara's control and instead seals the Ten-Tails into his body. Once he gains control of the beast's
                 power, Obito, because he lacks dual Rinnegan, creates a tree-form of the Ten-Tails, the flower of which will be used to cast the Infinite 
                 Tsukuyomi. Madara can't do anything to stop him due to the limitations of his reincarnated body, so he informs the Allied Shinobi Forces of what 
                 Obito is planning, indirectly spurring their counter-attack that removes the tailed beasts from Obito's body.[9]

         The plan "completed".<br>
         From his defeat and a conversation with both Naruto and Kakashi, Obito decides that all he's been doing up until now has been misguided and 
         that he was only running away from his original dream of saving the world as a Hokage would.[10] Remorseful, he prepares to restore to life 
         everyone that died during the War. Black Zetsu intervenes at the last minute, forcing him to revive Madara instead, a move that leaves Obito 
         greatly weakened and also near death's door. Madara, now properly alive again, is given the Rinnegan that Obito hid by a White Zetsu, which 
         he uses to seal all nine tailed beasts — including those sealed within B and Naruto — into the Demonic Statue. The Ten-Tails is reborn once 
         more and Madara becomes its jinchūriki.[11] Obito escapes to the other dimension so that Madara can't have the remaining Rinnegan. Despite 
         the efforts of Sasuke Uchiha and Naruto — both empowered by the Sage of the Six Paths — Madara is able to follow Obito and take his Rinnegan 
         back, awakening a Rinne Sharingan which he uses to cast the Infinite Tsukuyomi.

    <center><h2>THE FRIENDSHIP OF HASHIRAMA AND MADARA</h2></center>
    <p>
        when at their younger years they meet at a river and a frustrated Madara tries to skip his stone to the other side.
         Hashirama surprises Madara by skipping his stone as well and reaches the other side of the river. As Madara vents 
         out his frustration, a feeling humiliated Hashirama apologises to Madara and they started their unique friendship 
         despite not disclosing their surnames. Back in the Senju clan, a funeral for the fallen ninjas including Hashirama's
        younger brother, Kawarama, has been held. Hashirama vents out his disapproval to his father about children being 
        put to war but his father punches Hashirama. Hashirama talked to his brothers Tobirama and Itama about the ongoing
        war with the Uchiha clan and the utilisation of children to fight its adversary. Another fight erupts with the
        Senjus against the Uchihas and Itama has been killed by Uchiha shinobi. Hashirama arrives late and saw his brother
        dead. At the river, Madara notices a depressed Hashirama and Madara had the same feeling as well where he reveals 
        that he had also brothers who are fallen to the ongoing war. Despite their depression, they continue their training
        and their friendship blooms as well. After their training, Tobirama arrives to Hashirama telling that their father 
        has something to tell very important. At the Senju clan, Hashirama's father, Butsuma tells them that he asked Tobirama 
        to tail Hashirama and the boy, Madara, being acquainted to Hashirama hails from the Uchiha clan noting that Madara 
        killed adult ninjas from their clan. Butsuma warns Hashirama that this could lead to treason and in order from being 
        punished, Butsuma asks Hashirama to follow Madara after their training and if Madara becomes suspicious, 
        Butsuma recommends Hashirama to kill Madara.
